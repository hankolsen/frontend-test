# 2. Conceal the Password
So the form is submitting as expected, however the previous developer was clearly not too familiar with the web and how forms should be submitted.
As you probably noticed the form is submitting the values in the URL.
                                               
When you alert the company about this, they do realize that sending the password in clear text is a bad idea. 
Their ~~suggestion~~ order to you is to make sure that the password string is reversed and sent backwards instead. Can you do that?
