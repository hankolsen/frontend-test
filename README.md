# 1. Form Submit
You have been hired by Evil Corp to help them improve their website.

The previous developer seems to have mysteriously disappeared from the face of the earth and the documentation of his (yes it was obviously a male developer) work is no where to be found.

Your first task of your assignment at Evil Corp is to make their login page more usable.

There are a few problems with the login form that needs to be addressed:

## Submitting the form
For some reason the form doesn't submit. Can you fix the issue?

Once you have fixed the submit issue you can move on to the other tasks.

Great, with that out of the way you realize there is yet another issue with the form:
The values in the form doesn't seem to be sent when the form is submitted, so the login page is basically useless. 
How can you make the form values be submitted?

---

One more annoying thing about the login form is the "Remember me" checkbox. 
In order to toggle the checkbox you have to click the tiny checkbox itself, wouldn't it be nicer if you could click the entire text "Remember me" too?
