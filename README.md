# 3. Styling
The form ~~works~~ does its job, but it sure doesn't look that nice.

The only female employee at Evil Corp, Angela Moss, got the task to help out with the styling.

You are tasked to center the form both vertically and horizontally on the page.
Can you think of at least two ways how to achieve that?

Implement your favourite method of choice.
