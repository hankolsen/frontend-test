# frontend-test
This repo is intended as a small test for a potential front end engineer.

It consists of several branches with separate tasks to solve. 
The way it is intended from the start is that the test should be done "live" so that the problems can be discussed and not only rely on a "perfect" solution in code.  

Checkout each branch in the order they are numbered and try to solve the problems given to you.

Each new branch does contain a possible solution to the previous step, so make sure you do the tasks in correct order.

The objective of each task are:

0 - Make sure that the testee can clone a git repo and navigate between branches

1 - Basic HTML and especially about the `form` tag

2 - Standard Javascript questions about manipulating strings

3 - Different CSS techniques for styling a page and a form, and also a chance to show his/her design skills with an open ended task.


TODO:
- [x] Use git repo in order for the testee to show that he/she can clone a git repo and navigate between branches
- [x] Some basic form related HTML issues
- [x] Some Javascript tasks
- [x] Add tasks to style the page, for instance center the form on the page, prettify the inputs and labels...
- [ ] Add backend code for submitting the form
