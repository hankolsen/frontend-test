# 3. Styling
The form ~~works~~ does its job, but it sure doesn't look that nice.

The only female employee at Evil Corp, Angela Moss, got the task to help out with the styling. 
After all, she is a woman and should know a thing or two about colors and fashion.

You are tasked to center the content (the logo and the form) both vertically and horizontally on the page.
Can you think of at least two ways how to achieve that?

Make the content vertically and horizontally centered using your favourite method of choice.

Angela gets a headache and needs to go home. You are looking at the centered login page, 
and although it does look better, you have a feeling that it could be improved further.

How would you go about to style the page if you were given no restrictions?
