# frontend-test
This repo is intended as a small test for a potential front end engineer.

It consists of several branches with separate tasks to solve.

Checkout each branch in the order they are numbered and try to solve the problems given to you.

Each new branch does contain a possible solution to the previous step, so make sure you do the tasks in correct order.
